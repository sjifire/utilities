# Connecting to SJI Fire MCP Tools in Claude.ai

## Requirements

- Claude.ai Pro, Team, or Enterprise account
- Your @sjifire.org Microsoft account

## Steps

1. Go to [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) and sign in
2. Click your **profile icon** (bottom-left) → **Settings**
3. Go to **Integrations**
4. Click **"Add more integrations"**
5. Enter this URL:
   ```
   https://mcp.sjifire.org/mcp
   ```
6. Click **Connect** — you'll be redirected to Microsoft login
7. Sign in with your **@sjifire.org** account
8. You should see **"SJI Fire District"** appear as a connected integration

## Available Tools

Once connected, Claude can:

- **Dispatch** — Look up recent and open dispatch calls, call details, and call logs
- **Schedule** — Check who's on duty
- **Personnel** — Look up personnel info
- **Incidents** — Create and manage incident reports (in development)

## Using It

Just ask Claude naturally, e.g.:

- "Who's on duty today?"
- "Show me the dispatch calls from last week"
- "Pull up dispatch call 26-001234"

## Troubleshooting

If tools aren't working, try removing and re-adding the integration. The connection may time out after periods of inactivity.
